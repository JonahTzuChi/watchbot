# What is the main issue this bot trying to address?
At the point of writing, Telegram does not notify the Bot when a user delete a message. As result, the Bot's knowledge is not synchronized with the chat group it is monitoring.
This project aim to find out practical method/workflow to ensure that the Bot's synchronization with the chat group it is monitoring.
